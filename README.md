# ‚Äû Quote ‚Äù & Joke üòÑ

## Stuff I plan to learn in this project

- GetIt with ChangeNotifier for state management
- responsive design
- local databases
- Firebase ML kit
- complex animations


## What the application is gonna do

- get jokes or some quotes from APIs
- ability to save them
- save a quote/random text from some picture

 
## Update
- want to use Riverpod for state management instead
- the code was a complete mess so I'm working on refactoring everything currently

## What I got so far
It seems laggy in the gif, but it's actually working pretty well irl.
